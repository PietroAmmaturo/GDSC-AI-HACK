"Learning In The Deep" is a web application designed to enhance users' studying experience.
Upon uploading a PDF, the platform generates bullet points and a study path.
Users earn gems based on their performance. While the platform is free to use,
there's a limit on the number of study paths that can be generated. To unlock more paths,
users spend gems earned from completing tasks or opt to purchase the full version for
unlimited path generation.
