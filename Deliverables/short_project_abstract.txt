"Learning In The Deep" is a web application designed to augment users' learning experience by using generative AI.
Upon uploading any media file (e.g.: a PDF), the platform generates a course path formed by study blocks.
Each study block contains bullet points summarizing the original document section, as well as a quiz to test
if the user effectively learned the contents of the source.
When users give a wrong answer, the correct answer is explained using generative AI.
Users earn gems based on their performance. While the platform is free to use,
there's a limit on the number of study paths that can be generated. To unlock more paths,
users spend gems earned from completing tasks or opt to purchase the full version for
unlimited path generation.
